"To configure the database connection, first navigate to the config directory and locate the database.yaml file. Open the file in your preferred text editor and modify the following parameters: host (set to your database server IP), port (default is 5432 for PostgreSQL), username and password (your database credentials), and database_name (the target database). Save the file and restart the application service using the command 'sudo systemctl restart myapp'. The connection pool settings can be adjusted by modifying max_connections (recommended: 20-50) and timeout_seconds (recommended: 30). If authentication fails, verify your credentials and ensure the database server allows connections from your application server's IP address."
