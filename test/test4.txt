"Q3 2024 financial results show mixed performance across our product divisions. Revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $45.2 million, primarily driven by strong sales in our cloud services division, which grew 28% to $18.7 million. However, our traditional software licensing revenue declined 8% to $15.3 million as customers continue migrating to subscription-based models. Operating expenses rose 15% due to increased R&D spending and new hires in our AI development team. Net profit margin compressed from 18% to 14% compared to Q3 2023. Our customer acquisition cost improved by 22% thanks to more efficient digital marketing campaigns. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect continued growth in cloud services but anticipate further decline in traditional licensing revenue. Management projects overall revenue growth of 8-10% for the full year."
