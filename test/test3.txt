"This study investigates the effects of intermittent fasting on cognitive performance in healthy adults aged 25-65. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 200 participants divided into two groups: an intermittent fasting group following a 16:8 protocol (16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating window) and a control group maintaining regular eating patterns. Cognitive assessments were performed using standardized tests measuring working memory, attention span, and processing speed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Results showed significant improvements in working memory scores (p<0.05) and attention span (p<0.01) in the intermittent fasting group compared to controls. Processing speed showed marginal improvement (p=0.07). Blood glucose levels decreased by an average of 8% in the fasting group. These findings suggest that intermittent fasting may enhance certain cognitive functions, though longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained benefits."
