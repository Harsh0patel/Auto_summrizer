"Scientists at Stanford University have developed a new artificial intelligence system that can predict earthquakes up to one week in advance with 70% accuracy. The breakthrough, published in Nature Geoscience, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze seismic data patterns from over 130,000 earthquakes recorded between 2000 and 2023. Dr. Sarah Chen, the lead researcher, explained that the system identifies subtle precursor signals in underground rock formations that human analysts typically miss. The technology could potentially save thousands of lives by providing early warnings to communities in earthquake-prone regions like California, Japan, and Turkey. However, the research team cautions that the system still produces false alarms about 30% of the time and requires further refinement before widespread deployment."
