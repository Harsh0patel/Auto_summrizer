"The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 remains one of the most devastating urban disasters in American history. Beginning on October 8th and lasting for three days, the fire consumed approximately 3.3 square miles of the city, destroying over 17,000 structures including homes, businesses, and public buildings. An estimated 300 people lost their lives, and roughly 100,000 residents – nearly one-third of the city's population – were left homeless. The fire's rapid spread was facilitated by strong southwestern winds, an unusually dry summer, and the prevalence of wooden construction throughout the city. Contrary to popular legend, Mrs. O'Leary's cow did not start the fire by kicking over a lantern; this story was fabricated by journalist Michael Ahern. The disaster ultimately led to stricter building codes, improved fire safety measures, and the reconstruction of Chicago with more fire-resistant materials, contributing to the city's emergence as a major American metropolis."
