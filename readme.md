### Python API

```python
from summarizer import AutoSummarizer

# Initialize the summarizer
summarizer = AutoSummarizer()

# Summarize text
text = "Your long text content here..."
summary = summarizer.summarize(text, num_sentences=3)
print(summary)

# Summarize file
summary = summarizer.summarize_file("path/to/document.txt", num_sentences=5)
print(summary)
```

## 📊 Example

**Input Text:**
```
The field of artificial intelligence has grown rapidly in recent years. Machine learning algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, enabling computers to perform tasks that were once thought to be exclusively human. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been particularly successful in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. These advances have led to practical applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
